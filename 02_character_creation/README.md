## Ability Scores

Roll 3d6 for each primary ability score in this order:
* Charisma
* Constitution
* Dexterity
* Intelligence
* Strength
* Wisdom

If a score is **15** or higher, note **+1** next to it.  If a score is **8** or lower, note **-1** next to it.

Note two other scores:
* Spirit: This is 10 plus your Wisdom modifier (+1 or -1 if the score is high or low), resulting in a score between 9 and 11.
* Stability: This is 10 plus your Constitution modifier (+1 or -1 if the score is high or low), resulting in a score between 9 and 11.
