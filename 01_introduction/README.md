_don't trust the brain eaters_

After the royal family was killed, their jewels stolen, and Sun Isle Kingdoms decimated by a Deep Elf incursion, the Sidhe are out for blood. The Dwarven nations have finally replenished their populations and dream of retaking their kingdoms below the surface. The Black Network blew up the Emporer's Palace leaving a giant crater between the smuggler's Bonedock and Halls of the Netherpeak. The Gnomes of the Spiral Hills have become addicted to exotic dreamspices of the East and now sell their steam-powered mechanical monstrosities to fund their habit. 

Roam the subterranean cities and caves and hire on for assassinations between Deep Elf clans. Augment your psionic powers through braineater-flesh biografts. Grab your handcrossbow, katana, and mirror-spectacles.

## Preface

This game wears it's influences on it's sleeves.  The initial rules will be a shoddy fork of some old school rule systems turned into a frankenstein that's truly approapriate for a game of sanity blasting and flesh grafts.
