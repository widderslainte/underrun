# Glossary

* Biografts - Braineater arts of binding flesh, fungus, bone or metal to a lifeform. Also termed grafts, biological material is appended to another creature for an advantage, such as increased strength, psychic abilities, or enhanced vision.  Reported to cause physical or mental instability if abused.
* The Black Network - religio-fascist organization of Surface cattle devoted to the Lord of Oppression and seek to use the power and people of the World Below to dominate kingdoms of the Surface. 
* Bonedock - Smugglers’ den in the coastal caves beyond the Emperor's Palace.  Traditionally the most common place of the trade between the Surface and the World Below.  
* Braineaters - common name for the tentacle-faced alien scientists that have mastered the arts of biografting and are bound to the Thought Chain by their elders.  These psychic monstrosities are said to have originated by eating the brains of wizards to learn magical secrets and slowly transformed through their necromantic cannibalism.
* Cattle - Deep Elf term for most surface bipeds.  They recognise the Sidhe as weak reflections of themselves, but don’t distinguish between most other species.
* Chum - translation of ukitsozik, the Braineater term used generically for sentient biped
* Dagonites - carnivorous fish people native to the World Below.  While they may trade and form alliances with individual Deep Elf communities, their commitments are usually temporary and prone to backstabbing as soon as one side sees an opening.  The Dagonites control many waterways linking the World Below to the Surface.
* Deep Elf - strain of pale elves also known as myrkálfar. Cursed to live in the subterranean depths, these malevolent elves dominate some of the largest communities in the World Below.  The primary impediment to further conquest?  Treachery and infighting amongst themselves.
* Deep Elf Houses - multigenerational family structure of the wealthiest and most powerful Deep Elves.  They struggle against each other to rule communities in the World Below.
* Dream Spice - addictive powder that draws the user into a pleasant dream-like state.  One way for other species to access the Thought Chain.
* Dwarven Nations - Mountain fortress long ago ruled by Dwarven Kings.  They once straddled the border between the Surface and the World below until they were overrun by armies of the Goblings and Deep Elves.  Most dwarves fled to the Surface, trying to preserve their culture in small communities.  Now with the populations rebounding, many seek to reclaim their ancestral lands.
* Dverger - remnants of the Dwarven Nations that fled deeper in the earth as the mountain holds of the Dwarven Kings were overrun, their grip on morality and stability loosened as they lost contact with the Surface.  Commonly used as crafts folk by the Deep Elves and others in the World Below.
* The Emperor - former ruler over much of the Surface cattle, until foul magics of the Black Network destroyed his palace, opening a more obvious route to the World Below.
* Fungusfolk - Sentient fungus based bipeds who take a variety of forms.  Most can tap into the Thought Chain and are subjugated by both Deep Elves and Braineaters for that purpose or simply as a food source.
* Goblings - Deep Elf term for a variety of sentient bipeds that prefer the tunnels and caves to Surface.  Commonly used by the Deep Elves as guards and cannon fodder.
* Halls of the Netherpeak - another route from the Surface to the World Below, built by a mad wizard within the large mountain that overshadowed the Emperor’s Palace. It is whispered that the wizard’s ghost still walks these halls, commanding his apprentices, both living and dead.
Handspeech -  the common Trade Tongue of the World Below, using communication through hands and gestures.  Some species with more alien form adapt through telepathy, pheromones, and spores to bridge the gap.
* Interrogator - someone proficient in navigating, manipulating, and communicating through the Thought Chain.
* Katana - a single-edge curved sword common among Deep Elves in the World Below.  The Deep Elves wield them as a sign of superiority - they will still defeat you despite using such an impractical weapon in the narrow stone tunnels.

* Sotz - Batfolk native to the World Below, and often congregate in natural caverns that connect to the Surface. Frequently used as spies and messengers.
* Spiral Hills - Surface homeland of the gnomes, now a slum of dream spice addicted craftsmen. They now craft weapons and inventions for Braineaters in exchange for their fix.
* Sun Isle Kingdoms - island homeland of the Sidhe.
* Thought Chain  - Fungus based network that is woven from the Surface to the World Below, and used by the braineaters to control and communicate where magic would otherwise detect or prevent.  Sometimes considered the collective intelligence of the Braineaters themselves, as bound together by Mind Lords.
* Underrunner - independent mercenaries in the World Below.  Typically hired by Deep Elf Houses that want to maintain plausible deniability in actions against each other.
* The World Below - common term for the network of subterranean cities, communities, and caverns populated by Deep Elves and other sentient bipeds.
