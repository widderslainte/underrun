Families of Deep Elves and others of questionable morality fight against each other far below the Surface. They have struck back against surface dwellers and now drawn the eyes of the powers of the Surface as new passageways open to depths.  You’re mercenaries running espionage or covert warfare for ruling entities, merchant clans, or an opportunistic demon prince.

Roam the subterranean cities and caves of the World Below and hire on for assassinations between Deep Elf houses. Augment your psionic powers through braineater-flesh biografts. Grab your hand crossbow, katana, and mirror-spectacles.  _Don’t trust the brain eaters._
